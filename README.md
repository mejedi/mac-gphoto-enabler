mac-gphoto-enabler
==================

Mac OS X comes with its own framework for managing digital cameras.
This native framework must be disabled in order for gphoto to claim
and drive a camera.

We provide a script to do this in a reversible way on a per user basis.

Additionally we provide a daemon program that may be used by an application
built on top of gphoto to subscribe to camera discovered/camera gone
notifications.  While there is an open connection between the deamon
and an app, Mac OS X native digital camera framework is disabled automatically.

### Usage

`./gphoto-enable.sh` — prevent Mac OS X from claiming PTP cameras (for the current user)

`./gphoto-disable.sh` — revert changes

### How does it work?

We patch `/Library/Caches/com.apple.ImageCaptureNotifications.DeviceDiscoveryDatabase.${USERID}`.

This sqlite database contains the rules describing devices that are known to
image capture frawework. When a known device is attached the framework launches
the apropriate backend (ex: PTPCamera).

Each user has his own copy of DeviceDiscoveryDatabase. In the unlikely event we damage
the database MacOS X rebuilds it from scratch using data in
`/System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/*.app/Contents/Resources/DeviceMatchingInfo.plist`
(requires logout).
